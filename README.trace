* Configue options

  ./configure [--prefix=PFX] \
	    --target-list="x86_64-softmmu" \
	    --disable-kvm  \
	    --audio-card-list="" \
	    --disable-vnc-jpeg \
	    --disable-vnc-png \
	    --disable-strip

* Implementation choices
  
  If we don't want the virtual address, we could modify the macros in
  cpu-all.h (stl_p, ...).  We would still need the changes to the
  x86 code gen. in tcg/i386/tcg_target.c

* TODO

  - Log a timestamp (cycle counter?).  A global/synchronized clock
    would be best.
  - Turn tracing on and off with the magic instruction.
  - Only log shared read-write data.
